        <p>
            "Who am I?" It's the question that comes up the most indirectly. We try and define it by the things we've done, the things we do, and the things we want to do.
            Every interview, date, and essay makes us think about it a little bit more. I can't yet say I have a complete answer to who I am, but I know a few things.
            I'm a child of God. I'm happy. I'm moving forward.

        <h3 class="resumeTitle">Reading</h3>
        <p>Reading has always been one of my favorite passtimes. I used to read a lot fiction, but my tastes have changed over the years. Here are some of my favorite books from recent years:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>"Shoe Dog" by Phil Knight</li>
            <li>"A. Lincoln" by Ronald C. White Jr.</li>
            <li>"Can't Hurt Me" by David Goggins</li>
            <li>"Atomic Habits" by James Clear</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="resumeTitle">Cinematography</h3>
        <p> Here are a few of my favorite filmmakers. It's completely subjective, but I love the fun style of Taika Waititi and Casey Neistat. Christophen Nolan is legendary in his own right, but it's a little too serious at times for me.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Taika Waititi
